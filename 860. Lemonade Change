  /*
  Intuition:
When the customer gives us $20, we have two options:

To give tree $5 in return
To give one $5 and one $10.
On insight is that the second option (if possible) is always better than the first one.
Because two $5 in hand is always better than one $10

Explanation:
Count the number of $5 and $10 in hand.
If cutomer pay with $5: five++
If cutomer pay with $10: ten++, five--
If cutomer pay with $20: ten--, five-- or five -= 3
Check if five is positive, otherwise return false.

  C++:
  int lemonadeChange(vector<int> bills) {
        int five = 0, ten = 0;
        for (int i : bills) {
            if (i == 5) five++;
            else if (i == 10) five--, ten++;
            else if (ten > 0) ten--, five--;
            else five -= 3;
            if (five < 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
