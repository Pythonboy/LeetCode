# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented 
by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The 
given string will always end with a zero.

**Example**
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```

**Example**
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```

# Solution
**Java**
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int ones = 0;
        //Starting from one but last, as last one is always 0.
        for (int i = bits.length - 2; i >= 0 && bits[i] != 0 ; i--) { 
            ones++;
        }
        if (ones % 2 > 0) return false; 
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Java**
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int n = bits.length, i = 0;
        while (i < n - 1) {
            if (bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i += 2;
        }
        return i == n - 1;
    }
}
```

**Python**
```
if not bits: return False
    n = len(bits)
    
    index = 0
    while index < n:
        if index == n-1 : return True
        if bits[index] == 1: 
            index += 2              
        else: index += 1
    return False
```
