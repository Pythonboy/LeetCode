# 648. Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called `root`, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word `successor`. For example, the root `an`, followed by `other`, which can form another word `another`.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the `successor` in the sentence with the `root`forming it. If a `successor` has many `roots` can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```



**Note:**

1. The input will only have lower-case letters.
2. 1 <= dict words number <= 1000
3. 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
4. 1 <= root length <= 100
5. 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

        string temp = "",res = "",t;
        sentence += ' ';
