Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly `k` distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
```



**Note:**

1. The `n` and `k` are in the range 1 <= k < n <= $10^4$.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
        vector<int>Res(n);
        Res[0] = 1, Res[1] = 1+k;
        for(int i=2 ; i<k+1 ; i+=2)
        {
            Res[i] = Res[i-2] +1;
            Res[i+1] = Res[i-1] -1;
        }
        for(int i= 1+k ; i<n ; i++)
            Res[i] = i+1;
        return Res;
    }
};

        int[] res = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0, l = 1, r = n; l <= r; i++)
            res[i] = k > 1 ? (k-- % 2 != 0 ? l++ : r--) : l++;

        temp = [i+ steps + 1 for i in xrange(n-2*steps)]
        if k%2: return [k for i in xrange(steps) for k in [i+1,n-i]] + temp
        else: return [k for i in xrange(steps) for k in [n-i,i+1]] + temp
