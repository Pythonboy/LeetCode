/*

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

//My Answer
//思路一：用string.h中的strchr()来判断S中的字符是否在J中出现
int numJewelsInStones(char* J, char* S) {
    int sum = 0;
    int len = strlen(S);
    for(int i=0 ; i<len ; i++)
    {
        if(strchr(J,S[i]))
            sum++;
    }
    return sum;
}
