You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and
his direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance 
value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]],
and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not 
direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of 
this employee and all his subordinates.

**Example**
```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```


**Java  BFS**
```
class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        int total = 0;
        Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (Employee employee : employees) {
            map.put(employee.id, employee);
        }
        Queue<Employee> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(map.get(id));
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Employee current = queue.poll();
            total += current.importance;
            for (int subordinate : current.subordinates) {
                queue.offer(map.get(subordinate));
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}

```

**Java DFS**
```
class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (Employee employee : employees) {
            map.put(employee.id, employee);
        }
        return getImportanceHelper(map, id);
    }
    
    private int getImportanceHelper(Map<Integer, Employee> map, int rootId) {
        Employee root = map.get(rootId);
        int total = root.importance;
        for (int subordinate : root.subordinates) {
            total += getImportanceHelper(map, subordinate);
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```


**Python**
```
class Solution(object):
    def getImportance(self, employees, id):
        """
        :type employees: Employee
        :type id: int
        :rtype: int

        # Time: O(n)
        # Space: O(n)
        emps = {employee.id: employee for employee in employees}
        dfs = lambda id: sum([dfs(sub_id) for sub_id in emps[id].subordinates]) + emps[id].importance
        return dfs(id)         
  ```      
        
 **C++ BFS**
 ```
 class Solution {

        unordered_map<int, Employee*>m;

            auto p = q.front();
            q.pop_front();
            for(auto x: p->subordinates) q.push_back(m[x]);
            sum += p->importance;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
 ```
        
 **C++ DFS**
 ```

    void DFS(unordered_map<int, Employee*>& m, int id, int& sum){
