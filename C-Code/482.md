# 482. License Key Formatting
You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is 
separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the
first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash
inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example1**
```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

# Solution
**C++**
```
class Solution {
public:
    string licenseKeyFormatting(string S, int K) {
        string temp = "" , res = "";
        int len = 0;
        for(auto c : S)
        {
            if(c != '-')
            {
                len++;
                char t =  toupper(c);
                temp = temp + t;
            }
        }
        for(int i= len-1 , j = 1; i>= 0 ;i--,j++)
        {
            res = temp[i] + res;
            if(j % K == 0 && i!=0)
                res = "-"+res;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
