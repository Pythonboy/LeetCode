# 819. Most Common Word

```
Example:
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
```

**Notes**
1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
1 <= banned.length <= 100.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
Different words in paragraph are always separated by a space.
There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

```
class Solution {
public:
    string mostCommonWord(string paragraph, vector<string>& banned) {
        unordered_map<string, int>m;
        for(int i = 0; i < paragraph.size();){
            string s = "";
            while(i < paragraph.size() && isalpha(paragraph[i])) s.push_back(tolower(paragraph[i++]));
            while(i < paragraph.size() && !isalpha(paragraph[i])) i++;
            m[s]++;
        }
        for(auto x: banned) m[x] = 0;
        string res = "";
        int count = 0;
        for(auto x: m)
            if(x.second > count) res = x.first, count = x.second;
        return res;  
    }
};
