# 205. Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two 
characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

# Solution
**C++**
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        vector<int>S(256,0),T(256,0);
        int n = s.size();
        for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++)
        {
            if(S[s[i]] != T[t[i]]) return false;
            S[s[i]] = i+1;
            T[t[i]] = i+1;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
