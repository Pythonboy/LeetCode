# 686. Repeated String Match
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

# Solution
**C++**
```
class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedStringMatch(string A, string B) {
        int len_A = A.size(),len_B = B.size();
        int len = len_B / len_A + 2;
        string res = "";
        for(int i = 1 ; i<=len ; i++)
        {
            res = res + A;
            if(res.find(B) != string::npos)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
