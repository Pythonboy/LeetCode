# 463. Island Perimeter
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are 
connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one 
island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the
water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed
100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example**
```
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Answer: 16

**C++**
```
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if(grid.empty())
            return 0;
        int res = 0, row = grid.size(), col = grid[0].size();
        for(int i=0 ; i<row ; i++)
        {
            for(int j=0 ; j<col ; j++)
            {
                if(grid[i][j] == 1)
                {
                    if(i == 0)
                        res++;
                    else if(grid[i-1][j]==0)
                            res++;
                    if(i==row-1)
                        res++;
                    else if(grid[i+1][j] == 0)
                            res++;
                    if(j == 0)
                        res++;
                    else if(grid[i][j-1]==0)
                            res++;
                    if(j == col-1)
                        res++;
                    else if(grid[i][j+1] == 0)
                        res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
