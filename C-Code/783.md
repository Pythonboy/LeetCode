# Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two 
different nodes in the tree.
```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

**C++**

 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

            for(int i=0 ; i<S ; i++)

                    Tree.push(Node->right);
                }
                Res.insert(Node->val);
            }
        }
        auto j = Res.begin();
        int last = *(j++);
        for( ; j!=Res.end() ; j++)
        {
            Different = *j - last;
            if(Different < MinDifferent)
                MinDifferent = Different;
            last = *j;
        }
        return MinDifferent;
    }
};
