# Can Place Flowers
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted
in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, 
return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

**C++**
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int len = flowerbed.size();
        for(int i = 0 ; i<len ; i++)
        {
            if(i==0 || i==len-1)
            {
                if((flowerbed[i]==0 && i+1<len&&flowerbed[i+1]==0) || (flowerbed[i]==0 && i==len-1 && i-1>=0 && flowerbed[i-1]==0))
                {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
                else if(len == 1 && flowerbed[i] == 0)
                {
                    n--;
                }
            }
            else if(flowerbed[i]==0 && flowerbed[i-1]==0 && flowerbed[i+1]==0)
            {
                flowerbed[i]=1;
                i++;
                n--;
            }
            if(n <= 0)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
