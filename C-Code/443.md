# 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

**Example1**
```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example2**
```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

**Example3**
```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

```
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int count = 0;
        int len = chars.size();
        int k = 0;
        for(int i=0 ; i<len-1 ; i++)
        {
            count++;
            if(chars[i] != chars[i+1])
            {
                if(count == 1)
                {
                    chars[k++] = chars[i];
                }
                else
                {
                    chars[k++] = chars[i];
                    string temp = to_string(count);
                    for(auto c : temp)
                        chars[k++] = c;
                }
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        count++;
        if(count == 1)
        {
            chars[k++] = chars[len-1];
        }
        else
        {
            chars[k++] = chars[len-1];
            string temp = to_string(count);
            for(auto c : temp)
                chars[k++] = c;
        }
        chars.resize(k);
        return k;
    }
};
